THE MATRIX
					Written by
				Larry and Andy Wachowski
					April 8, 1996
	FADE IN ON:
	COMPUTER SCREEN
	So close it has no boundaries.
	A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
	heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
	the derma of black-neon glass.
	A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were 
	making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
	relentlessly patient, until --
					MAN (V.O.)
			Hello?
	Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
	faster than we read.
					SCREEN
			Call trans opt:  received.
			2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log>
					WOMAN (V.O.)
			I'm inside.  Anything to report?
	We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
	a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman, 
	TRINITY.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Let's see.  Target left work at
			5:01 PM.
					SCREEN
			Trace program:  running.
	The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
	Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
	digit phone number in the top corner.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			He caught the northbound Howard 
			line. Got off at Sheridan.  
			Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
			pack of beer and a box of Captain 
			Crunch.  Returned home.
	The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
	suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.
	We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each 
	digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
	the wheels of a slot machine.
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			All right, you're relieved.  Use
			the usual exit.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Do you know when we're going to
			make contact?
					TRINITY
			Soon.
	Only two thin digits left.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Just between you and me, you don't 
			believe it, do you?  You don't 
			believe this guy is the one?
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus believes he is.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			I know.  But what about you?
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I think Morpheus knows things that
			I don't.
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, but if he's wrong --
	The final number pops into place --
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Did you hear that?
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Hear what?
					SCREEN
			Trace complete.  Call origin:
			#312-555-0690
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			Are you sure this line is clean?
					CYPHER (V.O.)
			Yeah, course I'm sure.
	We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green 
	numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.
					TRINITY (V.O.)
			I better go.
					CYPHER (V.O.) 
			Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.
	She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
	netherworld of the computer screen.
	Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around 
	us.
					RADIO (V.O.)
			Attention all units.  Attention
			all units.
	Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
	ourselves in --
	INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
	The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way 
	across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms 
	as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving 
	patterns of permanent shadow.
	We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as 
	they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
	on either side of room 303.
	The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --
	The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
	them.
					BIG COP
			Police!  Freeze!
	The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
	up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook 
	computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
	computer.
	Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is 
	TRINITY; a woman in black leather.
					BIG COP
			Get your hands behind your head!
	Trinity rises.
					BIG COP
			Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
			it!
	She slowly puts her hands behind her head.
	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
	A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the 
	police cruisers.
	AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.
	They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They 
	are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones 
	in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
	collars.
					AGENT SMITH
			Lieutenant?
					LIEUTENANT
			Oh shit.
					AGENT SMITH 
			Lieutenant, you were given 
			specific orders --
					LIEUTENANT
			I'm just doing my job.  You gimme 
			that Juris-my dick-tion and you 
			can cran it up your ass.
					AGENT SMITH
			The orders were for your protection.
	The Lieutenant laughs.
					LIEUTENANT
			I think we can handle one little
			girl.
	Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
	hotel.
					LIEUTENANT
			I sent two units.  They're 
			bringing her down now.
					AGENT SMITH
			No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.
	INT.  CHASE HOTEL
	The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding 
	a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know 
	they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff 
	and Trinity moves --
	It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly 
	fast.
	The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose 
	explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
	begins to fall.
	And Trinity is moving again --
	Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop 
	FIRES --
	A head explodes.
	In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed 
	black hole --
	And FIRES --
	Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she 
	reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
	The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his 
	windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.
	She looks at the four bodies.
					TRINITY
			Shit.
	EXT.  CHASE HOTEL
	Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for 
	the alley.
	INT.  CHASE HOTEL
	Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is 
	answered.
					MAN (V.O.)
			Operator.
					TRINITY
			Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
			don't know how.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I know.  Stay calm.
					TRINITY
			Are there any agents?
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.
					TRINITY
			Goddamnit!
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			You have to focus.  There is a 
			phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
			make it.
	She takes a deep breath, centering herself.
					TRINITY
			All right --
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go.
	She drops the phone.
	INT.  HALL
	She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
	leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the 
	opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the 
	fire escape.
	EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE
	In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at 
	her.  She can only go up.
	EXT.  ROOF
	On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over 
	the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.
	Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her 
	moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
	contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.
	Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.
	The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity 
	turns to it, racing for the back of the building.
	The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next 
	building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is 
	perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other 
	roof.
	The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something 
	ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself 
	into the air.
	From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she 
	hangs in flight
	Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.
					COP
			Motherfucker -- that's impossible!
	They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the 
	move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto 
	one knee.
	Just below the building are the runbling tracks of 
	riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a 
	rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
	easily.
	She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air 
	barely reaching the last car
	Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.
	Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.
	Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point 
	where the train has begun to turn, there is --
	A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
	building.
	Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her 
	speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL 
	rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
	turn.
	Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body 
	leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
	as --
	The whole world seems to spin on its axis --
	And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then 
	falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
	stairs bleeding, broken --
	But still alive.
	Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
	still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
	wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train 
	slides him past the window.
	Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.
					TRINITY
			Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
			Get up -- just get up!
	She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.
	EXT.  STREET
	Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the 
	end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
	sees it.
	The telephone booth.
	Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
	focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
	begins to RING.
	Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its 
	TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.
	Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
	telephone booth as if taking aim.
	Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --
	Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
	bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --
	She answers the phone.
	There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking 
	mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --
	Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
	wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.
	After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of 
	the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
	There is no body.  Trinity is gone.
	His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
	AGENT JONES walks up behind him.
					AGENT SMITH
			Did you get anything from the
			room?
					AGENT JONES
			Their next target.  The name is
			Neo.
	The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
	separated in the crash like a severed limb.
					AGENT SMITH
			We'll need a search running.
					AGENT JONES
			It's already begun.
	We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER 
	and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out 
	like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
	through one --
	Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --
	A computer screen.
	We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." 
	It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.
					SCREEN
			JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
			on this board.
			SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
			exist and the Matrix is nothing 
			but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
			game.
			TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
			Trinity really a girl?
			LODIII:  87% of all women on line
			are really men.
			QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism 
			for the government.
			SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
			system controlling our lives.
			TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
			SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
			FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!
	We drift back from the electric conversation entering --
	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
	It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
	technology.
	Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
	thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
	desks.
	Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
	open like an autopsied corpse.
	We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
	technology, following the slurping and crunching of
	cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --
	NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a 
	computer than living outside one.
					NEO
			Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.
	He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an 
	anonynous message slices onto the screen.
					SCREEN
			Do you want to know what the
			Matrix is, Neo?
	Neo is frozen when he reads his name.
					SCREEN
			SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
			JACKON:  Who's Neo?
			GIBSON:  This is a private board.
			If you want to know, follow the
			white rabbit.
					NEO
			What the hell...
					SCREEN
			TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
			hackers!
			FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
			JACKON:  Identify yourself.
			Knock, knock, Neo.
	A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
	his door he almost jumps out of his chair.
	He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
	message is gone.
	He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
	Again, someone knocks.
	Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.
					VOICE (O.S.)
			Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?
	Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
	who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
	of friends.
					NEO
			What do you want, Anthony?
					ANTHONY
			I need your help, man.  Desperate.
			They got me, man.  The shackles of 
			fascism.
	He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
	boot.
					NEO
			You got the money this time?
	He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
	Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.
					DUJOUR
			You can really get that thing off,
			right now?
					ANTHONY
			I told you, honey, he may look 
			like just another geek but this 
			here is all we got left standing 
			between Big Brother and the New
			World Order.
	EXT.  STREET
	A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
	wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.
	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
	They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
	robotically, climb into their van.
					ANTHONY
			Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't 
			think about what they're- doing or
			why.  Computer tells 'em what to
			do and they do it.
					FRIEND #l
			Thc banality of evil.
	He slaps the money in Neo's hand.
					ANTHONY
			Thanks, neighbor.
					DUJOUR
			Why don't you come to the party
			with us?
					NEO
			I don't know.  I have to work
			tomorrow.
					DUJOUR
			Come on.  It'll be fun.
	He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
	leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
	symbols, slogans, military medals and --
	A small white rabbit.
	The ROOM TILTS.
					NEO
			Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.
	INT.  APARTMENT
	An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a 
	chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
	casements.
	Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there 
	are.
	Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
	gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
	jungle cats around a tree.
	Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
	of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
	leave when he notices a woman staring at him.
	The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.
	In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
	each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.
					TRINITY
			Hello, Neo.
					NEO
			How did you know that --
					TRINITY
			I know a lot about you.  I've been
			wanting to meet you for some time.
					NEO
			Who are you?
					TRINITY
			My name is Trinity.
					NEO
			Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
			Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
			Kansas City D-Base?
					TRINITY
			That was a long time ago.
					NEO
			Gee-zus.
					TRINITY
			What?
					NEO
			I just thought... you were a guy.
					TRINITY
			Most guys do.
	Neo is a little embarrassed.
					NEO
			Do you want to go sorewhere and
			talk?
					TRINITY
			No.  It's safe here and I don't
			have much time.
	The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
	directly into each other's ear.
					NEO
			That was you on the board tonight.
			That was your note, wasn't it?
					TRINITY
			I had to gamble that you would see
			and they wouldn't.
					NEO
			Who wouldn't?
					TRINITY
			I can't explain everything to you.
			I'm sure that it's all going to
			seem very strange, but I brought
			you here to warn you, Neo.  You
			are in a lot of danger.
					NEO
			What?  Why?
					TRINITY
			They're watching you.  Something
			happened and they found out about
			you.  Normally, if our target is
			exposed we let it go.  But this
			time, we can't do that.
					NEO
			I don't understand --
					TRINITY
			You came here because you wanted
			to know the answer to a hacker's
			question.
					NEO
			The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?
					TRINITY
			Twelve years ago I met a man, a
			great man, who said that no one
			could be told the answer to that
			question.  That they had to see
			it, to believe it.
	Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.
					TRINITY
			He told me that no one should look
			for the answer unless they have to
			because once you see it,
			everything changes.  Your life and
			the world you live in will never
			be the same.  It's as if you wake
			up one morning and the sky is
			falling.
	There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
	the words like a drug, seeping into him.
					TRINITY
			The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
			looking for you and it will find
			you, if you want it to.
	She takes hold of him with her eyes.
					TRINITY
			That's all I can tell you right
			now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
			luck.
					NEO
			Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
			man?
	She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
	whispers.
					TRINITY
			You know who.
	She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
	of bodies.
	A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
	pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --
							CUT TO:
	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT
	The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
	consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
	9:15 A.M.
					NEO
			Shitshitshit.
	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER
	The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
	company.
	INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE
	The main offices are along each wall, the windows
	overlooking downtown Chicago.
	RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
	without looking at him, typing at his computer
	continuously.
	Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
	outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
	surface of the glass.
					RHINEHEART
			You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
			You think that you're special.
			You believe that somehow the rules
			do not apply to you.
	He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
	time.
					RHINEHEART
			Obviously, you are mistaken.
	His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.
					RHINEHEART
			This company is one of the top
			software companies in the world
			because every single employee
			understands that they are a part
			of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
			has a problem, the company has a
			problem.
	He turns again.
					RHINEHEART
			The time has come to make a 
			choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
			choose to be at your desk on time
			from this day forth, or you choose
			to find yourself another job.  Do
			I make myself clear?
					NEO
			Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
			clear.
	INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE
	The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
	labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
	elevators.
	Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
	up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.
					TALL EMPLOYEE
			What did he say?
					NEO
			If I was late again, I'm going to
			be fired.
	He smirks.
					TALL EMPLOYEE
			Well, it was nice working with
			you.
	Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.
					VOICE (O.S.)
			Thomas Anderson?
	Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
	door.
					NEO
			Yeah.  That's me.
	Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
	the softpak.
					FEDEX
			Have a nice day.
	He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
	the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
	flips it open.
					NEO
			Hello?
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.
	Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I had hoped for this conversation
			to take place under less adverse
			conditions, but you can never
			count on hope, can you, Neo?
					NEO
			... no.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I've been watching you, Neo, and I
			want to meet you.  I don't know if
			you're ready to see what I want to
			show you, but unfortunately, we
			have run out of time.  They're
			coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
			sure what they're going to do.
					NEO
			Who's coming for me?
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stand up and see for yourself.
					NEO
			Right now?
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.  Now.
	Neo starts to stand.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.
	His head slowly peeks up over the partition.
	At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
	leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
	points out Neo's cubicle.
	Neo ducks.
					NEO
			Holy fuckin' shit!
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Yes.
	One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
	agents.
					NEO
			What the fuck do they want with
			me?!
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
			want to find out, you better get
			out of there.
					NEO
			How?!
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I can guide you out, but you have
			to do exactly what I say.
	The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The cubicle across from you is
			empty.
					NEO
			But what if...?
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Go!  Now!
	Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
	just as the agents turn into his row.
	Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
	tightly to him.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Stay here for a moment.
	The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
	search the bathroom.
	Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			A little longer...
	Brown is talking to the tall employee.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			When I tell you, go to the end of
			the row to the first office on the
			left, stay.as low as you can.
	Sweat trickles down his forehead.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Now.
	Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
	freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.
	Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
	across the opening to the first office on the left.
	The room is empty.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Good.  Now there is a window.
			Open it.
					NEO
			How do you know all this?
	Morpheus laughs quietly.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			The answer is coming, Neo.
	He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
			can use it to get to the roof.
	Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
	several offices away.
					NEO
			No! It's too far away.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			There's a small ledge.  It's a
			short climb.  You can make it.
	Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
	concrete chasm.
					NEO
			No way, no way, this is crazy.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Don't be controlled by your fear,
			Neo.  There are only two ways out
			of this building.  One is that
			scaffold.  The other is in their
			custody.  You take a chance either
			way.  I leave it to you.
	CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
	the scaffold.
					NEO
			This is insane!  Why is this
			happening to me?  What did I do?
			I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
			Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!
	He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
	frame, he steps onto the small ledge.
	The scaffold seems even farther away.
					NEO
			I'm going to die.
	The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
	knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
	the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.
	He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.
					NEO
			This is insane.  I can't do this!
			Forget it!
	He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
	door.
					NEO
			I didn't do anything!
	EXT.  SKYSCRAPER
	The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
	doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
	dark sedan.
	Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
	motorcycle.
					TRINITY
			Shit.
	INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR
	A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
	a table alone.
	We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
	monitor were a window.
	At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.
	Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
	slaps down on the table between them.
	Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas 
	A."
					AGENT SMITH
			As you can see, we've had our eye
			on you for some time now, Mr.
			Anderson.
	He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
	flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
	the file or at him.
					AGENT SMITH
			It seems that you have been living
			two lives.  In one life, you are
			Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
			for a respectable software
			company.  You have a social
			security number, you pay your
			taxes and you help your land lady
			carry out her garbage.
	The pages continue to turn.
					AGENT SMITH
			The other life is lived in
			computers where you go by the
			hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
			of virtually every computer crime
			we have a law for, including the
			unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
			system for the removal of
			automobile boots.
	Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.
					AGENT SMITH
			One of these,lives has a future.
			One of them does not.
	He closes the file.
					AGENT SMITH
			I'm going to be as forthcoming as
			I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
			here because we need your help.
	He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
	blue.
					AGENT SMITH
			We know that you have been
			contacted by a certain individual.
			A man who calls himself Morpheus.
			Whatever you think you know about
			this man is irrelevant to the fact
			that he is wanted for acts of
			terrorism in more countries than
			any other man in the world.  He is
			considered by many authorities to
			be the most dangerous man alive.
	He leans closer.
					AGENT SMITH
			My colleagues believe that I am
			wasting my time with you, but I
			believe you want to do the right
			thing.  It is obvious that you are
			an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
			and that you are interested in the
			future.  That is why I believe you
			are ready to put your past
			mistakes behind you and get on
			with your life.
	Neo tries to match his stare.
					AGENT SMITH
			We are willing to wipe the slate
			clean, to give you a fresh start
			and all we are asking in return is
			your cooperation in bringing a
			known terrorist to justice.
	Neo nods to himself.
					NEO
			Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
			real good deal.  But I think I
			have a better one.  How about I
			give you the finger --
	He does.
					NEO
			And you can cram that file up your
			Secret Service sphincter.
	Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.
					AGENT SMITH
			You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.
					NEO
			You ain't seen nothing yet.
					AGENT SMITH
			The irony of your situation is
			that you have no choice.
					NEO
			You can't scare me with this
			gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
			I want my phone call.
	Agent Smith smiles.
					AGENT SMITH
			And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
			good is a phone call iy you are
			unable to speak?
	The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
	feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.
	The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
	grow into panic.
	Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
	seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
	mouth is gone.
	Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
	restrain him holding him in the chair.
					AGENT SMITH
			You are going to help us, Mr.
			Anderson, whether you want to or
			not.
	Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.
	From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
	long, fiber-optic wire tap.
	Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
	his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
	electronic device animates, become an organic creature
	that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.
	Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
	Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
	which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --
	Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
	worms its way inside.
	INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
	Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.
	He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
	is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
	deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --
	The PHONE RINGS.
	It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
	building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
	sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
	He answers it, saying nothing.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.).
			This line is tapped, so I must be
			brief.
					NEO
			The agents --
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			They got to you first, but they've
			underestimated how important you
			are.  If they knew what I know,
			you would probably be dead.
	Neo feels sick.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			I don't know what you are thinking
			right now but I want you to
			understand that I will not give up
			on you until you give up on me.
	Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Do you still want to meet?
					NEO
			... Yes.
					MORPHEUS (V.O.)
			Take the Howard line south.
	CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.
	EXT.  EL TRAIN
	An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.
	INT.  TRAIN
	It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
	night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
	everything nervously.
	There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
	the door is opened.
	Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
	sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
	and he walks straight at Neo.
					APOC
			Come with me.
	Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
	two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.
	Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
	is no upcoming station.
	Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
	against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
	slams against the metal rail.
	The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
	balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --
	He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
	from, the raised tracks --
	Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
	a truck races under him and --
	He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
	boxes.
	INT.  TRUCK BED
	Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
	man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
	next to him, talking into a cellular phone.
					TRINITY
			We got him.  Call the chop-shop.
	She hangs up.
					TRINITY
			Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
			trust us.
	She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
	for his face.
					NEO
			What are you doing?
					TRINITY
			This has to be done for your
			protection and ours.
	She seals his eyes shut with the tape.
					TRINITY
			You can't understand right now,
			but if you're not one of us,
			you're one of them.
	EXT.  LOWER WACKER
	A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
	curls down from the city's surface.
	trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
	the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
	looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
	a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.
	His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
	exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
	braces.
					GIZMO
			Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
			software around.
					TRINITY
			Hello, Gizmo.
	Neo hears the voices around him.
					GIZMO
			This is really the guy?  The guy
			that Morpheus thinks --
					TRINITY
			Yeah.
					GIZMO
			But he's so old.
					TRINITY
			Are you going to help us or aren't
			you?
					GIZMO
			Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
			and let's get the hell outta here.
	Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
	shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.
	A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
	over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
	underworld.
	INT.  VAN
	The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
	meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
	medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
	cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.
	Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
	nervously as Gizmo gets to work.
					GIZMO
			Okay, first we take a little look
			under the hood.
	He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
	blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
	to varying levels of magnification.
					GIZMO
			You're going to feel a little
			prick.
	He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
	abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
	Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.
					NEO
			What are you doing?
					TRINITY
			We think you're bugged.  We can't
			take you to Morpheus until you're
			clean.
					GIZMO
			There it is.
	On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
	intestines.
