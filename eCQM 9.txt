Rationale	
Exclusive breast milk feeding for the first 6 months of neonatal life has long been the expressed goal of World Health Organization (WHO), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG has recently reiterated its position (ACOG, 2018). A Cochrane review substantiates the benefits (Kramer & Kakuma, 2012). Much evidence has now focused on the prenatal and intrapartum period as critical for the success of exclusive (or any) breast feeding (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2020; CDC, 2013; Petrova, Hegyi, & Mehta, 2007; Taveras et al., 2004). Exclusive breast milk feeding rate during birth hospital stay has been calculated by the California Department of Public Health for the last several years using newborn genetic disease testing data. Healthy People 2020 and the CDC have also been active in promoting this goal.
Clinical Recommendation Statement	
Exclusive breast milk feeding for the first 6 months of neonatal life can result in numerous long-term health benefits for both mother and newborn and is recommended by a number of national and international organizations. Evidence suggests that the prenatal and intrapartum period is critical for the success of exclusive (or any) breast feeding. Therefore, it is recommended that newborns are fed breast milk only from birth to discharge.

Definition	
None
Guidance	
A discharge to a designated cancer center or children's hospital should be captured as a discharge to an acute care facility.

Data show that the majority of newborns with gestational age 37 weeks or more have a birth weight 3000 grams or more. Birth weight 3000 grams or more is a proxy to capture term newborns without gestational age recorded in EHR system. Only one birth weight value should be recorded. In cases where there is conflicting data, use the document recording the birth weight closest to the start of encounter.

If dextrose or glucose 40% gel is given, it is considered a medication not a feeding. This should be reflected as such in the newborn's EHR documentation.

This eCQM is an episode-based measure. An episode is defined as each inpatient hospitalization or encounter that ends during the measurement period.

This version of the eCQM uses QDM version 5.6. Please refer to the eCQI Resource Center (https://ecqi.healthit.gov/qdm) for more information on the QDM.
